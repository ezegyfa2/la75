They are not cost effective, they use a lot of energy, they need huge batteries which make their price too high and they are too big for parking too. Modern electric cars have ended up being excessive and wasteful. But not all of them. eDI solves all these problems with a smaller vehicle. eDI is an electric diwheel which combines the closed-space driving experience of cars with the low energy requirements of smaller motorcycles. Among the several advantages compared to a traditional car, with 80 Wh/km energy consumption it will be one of the most efficient urban vehicle making cars unnecessary for everyday usage. It also has very little space requirements for parking, and designed for economical and green production, which involves less CO2 emission and material costs than cars.',
